# Core Concept

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. It uses containerization technology to package applications and their dependencies into portable containers.

## What is a Container?
A container is a lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that includes:
- Application code
- Runtime
- System tools
- System libraries
- Configuration

## Benefits of Docker
- **Consistency** across environments
- **Lightweight & Fast** startup
- **Portability** on Linux, macOS, Windows, and cloud providers
- **Isolation** between applications
- **Scalability & Modularity** for microservices

## Docker Ecosystem Overview
- **Docker Engine**: daemon, REST API, and CLI
- **Docker Image**: blueprint template for containers
- **Docker Container**: running instance of an image
- **Docker Hub**: registry to store and share images
- **Docker Desktop**: packaged environment for Windows/macOS
