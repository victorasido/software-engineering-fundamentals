# Docker Fundamental Documentation
A complete modular documentation covering Docker basics, container lifecycle, networking, environment variables, and Compose, designed to help you build a strong foundation in containerization and modern DevOps practices.

## Overview
This repository contains a structured set of Docker learning modules.
Each module is separated into its own Markdown file to ensure clarity, modularity, and maintainability — following industry-standard documentation practices.

You will learn:
- How Docker works internally
- How to pull, run, and manage containers
- How container lifecycle works
- How to pass environment variables
- How Docker networking operates
- How to run multi-container apps using Compose
