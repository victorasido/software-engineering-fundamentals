# HTTP Fundamentals — Summary

## Key Takeaways

### TCP
- Reliable, ordered transport layer  
- Provides stable connection before HTTP operates  

### HTTP
- Stateless request–response protocol  
- Uses methods, headers, and status codes  
- Backbone of all web communication  

### HTTPS
- Adds TLS encryption  
- Ensures security: confidentiality, integrity, authentication  

### API Gateway vs Backend
- Gateway = routing, auth, traffic control  
- Backend = core logic, DB operations
